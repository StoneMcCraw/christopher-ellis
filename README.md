Stone Anderson McCraw - Chancellor Noble - Christopher Ellis Jr
From Madison Academic Highschool

This is a photography website for our client who happens to be Christopher's father
In the said website we decided we would give you a basis of what our client can do and some examples of his work and how to contact him
We didn't know how to create a homepage so we wanted a camera to flash at you before you went to the page but a logo went better with the grand scheme of things
We struggled with making our website responsive.
Getting the calendar to be responsive was an issue for us. Chancellor went to "theCo". and Christen helped him get the calendar
responsive.
We made the gallery page with a very strange format that took many days to figure out
For the pricing page we went through extensive trial and error and finally came up with a design that went "well" with the design we had in mind
